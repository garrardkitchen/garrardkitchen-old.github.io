I love all things technological. I am an early adopter of technologies. I'm a huge fan and advocate of the Scrum / Kanban Frameworks and spend most of days working with the Windows Azure platform.

Outside of this work space I have a wife and we currently reside in the north of England. I've not long been married, october 2008, and my blog/twitter picture is of me on a beach in the Maldives on our honeymoon. We have 2 sons. When I'm not working I love to cook and spend time with my wonderful wife, often at the same time as we both have a passion for cooking. Other favourite pass times of mine are gym'ing and ju-jitsu (dan grade) and I do like to hit the occasional golf ball down at my local driving range.
