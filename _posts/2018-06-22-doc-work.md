I've been doing a ton of interesting and challenging work over the past year so I've decided to start documenting this work here.  The idea is to have a record of <b>what</b> I've been doing, <b>why</b> I've been doing them, <b>challenges</b> I've had to overcome and any <b>learning points</b> worth sharing.

I don't know how this is going to work out and due to (a) availability and (b) to the sensitive nature of some of the work we do, the detail might be, in places, a little sparse.
